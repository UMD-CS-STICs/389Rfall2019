## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (25 pts)

This was done via the [ELMS assignment](). (we'll post an announcement when this is ready!)

### Part 2 (75 pts)

My first course of action would be to inform my supervisor or boss, whoever the head of the department is. It is crucial that we keep this information internal while we discuss solutions and attempt to 
address the problem. Hopefully the company I am working for cares about its' consumers, however if they do not, I would attempt to patch the exploits myself. I would only notify the public of the 
security issues if my company does not delay the release or postpone it all together. I am assuming that this would get me fired from my position as ECU auditor as exposing internal information is quite 
the no-no, i might even face legal consequences for doing this. Ethically speaking, I believe my employers would be more guilty than I in this situation. If they choose to ignore my warnings they are 
potentially risking the lives of all their customers. The ECU is an extremely important part of the car; comparable to the 'brain' of the vehicle. 

If I were to do nothing, I would surely be held responsible for any damage, injury, or death caused by these vulnerable ECU's. My job is to audit, and if I do not do my job properly then I deserve to be 
held accountable. This is quite the tragic situation, I am sure there have been many internal whistleblowers who have lost their jobs or faced legal prosecution for something like this.
